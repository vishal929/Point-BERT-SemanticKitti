# Point Cloud Semantic Segmentation on SemanticKitti using Point Bert 

This is a project for Rutgers CS-534, where we take a pretrained transformer for point clouds (Point-Bert),
and we apply it to a new dataset: SemanticKitti. In order to enhance the model we refine predictions of the network
with a refinement scheme P^2Net.

This repository was forked from the Point bert official repository, and all our work is done in the segmentation folder.
The original readme is in the root at original_README.md.
